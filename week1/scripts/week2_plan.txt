WEEK 2 CLEANING PLAN
====================
Name: [Mia Dowdell]
Date: [06/02/2026]

I've completed all 5 tutorials and application checklists.

Looking across all my checklists, these are the 2 most important issues 
to address in Week 2:


ISSUE 1 (Most Important)
-------------------------
Brief description: [string-related inconsistencies (capitalisation and typos)]

Which tutorial provides the solution: [3 - strings]

Which variable(s) affected: [site, treatment]

Why this is important to fix: [Ensure consistent data and can be visualised]

What I plan to do: [Fix capitalisation mistakes to group treatment correctly, fix dash typos on body_mass values as biologically impossible]



ISSUE 2 (Second Most Important)
--------------------------------
Brief description: [Biological impossibilities]

Which tutorial provides the solution: [7.1 check data consistency]

Which variable(s) affected: [body_mass_ng]

Why this is important to fix: [data most likely correct but typo = makes it wrong]

What I plan to do: [check data through basic range checks, filter data to identify impossible values, and flag for later correction]



OTHER ISSUES I NOTICED (but won't fix in Week 2)
-------------------------------------------------
- [Issue 3 - NA values in collector column]
- [Issue 4 - ]
- [Issue 5 - ]


QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS IN WEEK 2
-------------------------------
Things I'm still unsure about:

1. Why during flagging of flag_id_weight, female_id 98 is the only one being highlighted when code asks for all 3 negative inputs?

2. 

3.
